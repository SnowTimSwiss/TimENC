# TimENC üîê

**TimENC** is a modern, cross-platform encryption tool built with Python and Tkinter.  
It uses **ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD** encryption and **Argon2id** key derivation for strong, authenticated encryption ‚Äî designed to be **secure, simple, and open-source**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Strong encryption** with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (authenticated AEAD)
- **Secure password-based key derivation** using Argon2id
- **Keyfile support** for additional entropy
- **Automatic directory archiving and encryption**
- **Tamper-resistant headers** (AAD authentication)
- **Protection against tar path traversal**
- **Atomic file writes and secure permissions (600)**
- **Optional secure deletion of source files**
- **Simple, user-friendly GUI (Pyside6)**
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## üîí Cryptography Details

| Component | Algorithm | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| **Cipher** | ChaCha20-Poly1305 | 256-bit key, 96-bit nonce |
| **KDF** | Argon2id | Time-hard and memory-hard, resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks |
| **Authentication** | AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) | Protects all header metadata |
| **Keyfile** | Random 256-bit | Optional additional entropy |
| **Hashing** | SHA-256 (for keyfile combination) | Before key derivation |

### Default Argon2 Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| Time cost | 6 |
| Memory cost | 131072 KiB (128 MB) |
| Parallelism | 2 |

These parameters can be adjusted to increase or decrease computational cost based on your system performance.

## üß† How It Works

1. You select a **file or directory**.
2. TimENC creates a **temporary TAR archive** (for directories).
3. It derives a **key** from your password (and optional keyfile) using Argon2id.
4. The data is encrypted with **ChaCha20-Poly1305**, and all metadata is authenticated.
5. The output `.timenc` file contains everything necessary to decrypt.
6. During decryption, all parameters and metadata are verified before decryption.
